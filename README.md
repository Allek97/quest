<p align="center"> Quest (1st project) is an interactive app that allows you to run multiple pathfinding and perfect maze generation algorithms in a 2D grid. The goal is to find the most optimized path (if possible) between the knight and the princess while facing many obstacles. This application visualizes all the various algorithms and more !

## ü•≥ About This Production <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

I took a javascript course in college which I enjoyed a lot, solving problems using algorithms was my favourite part. One day, I stumbled into [Jamis Buck blog](https://weblog.jamisbuck.org/) about maze generation algorithms which I found fascinating. I decided to test my newly acquired React skills and make a project out of it.

As it says in the description, Quest is a visualisation tool that allows you to interact with a 2d Grid.You can run pathfinding algorithms, generate perfect mazes with unique algorithms, add walls,weights,rewards and more.

There is also a LORE section where I explain some of the algorithms/data structures I implemented for this app, it's still on progress, I will be adding new content soon.

## ‚õèÔ∏è Built With <a name = "tech_stack"></a>

-   [React/Create React App](https://reactjs.org/) - I used Create React App to build user interfaces in this web application.
-   [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) - I used SCSS for the styling with Block Element Modifier (BEM) notation.
-   [Netlify](https://www.heroku.com/) - I deployed the react app on the Netlify.
